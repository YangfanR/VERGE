# VERGE

This repository contains the code for the VERGE (Varying Effects Regression with Graph Estimation) algorithm as described in the manuscript under revision in Biometrics:

**"Bayesian network-guided sparse regression with flexible varying effects]{Bayesian network-guided sparse regression with flexible varying effects."**


Authors: Yangfan Ren, Christine B. Peterson, and Marina Vannucci

## Overview

The VERGE algorithm is implemented in Matlab and is a Bayesian hierarchical regression model that enables the selection of both network-linked predictor variables and covariates that modify the predictor effects.
